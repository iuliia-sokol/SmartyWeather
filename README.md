# smartyWeather

SmartyWeather App, built using React.JS, is a web-based application that can
monitor the entire weather condition of wherever the user happened to be.

This simple weather app is not only visually attractive, but also can be really
helpful to user's daily living. The App deals with a reliable weather condition
and data on weather which is accurate and can be helpful for monitoring the
condition of the weather outside or any specific place.

In addition, user can easily explore what happened today in history around the
world, including major events on crime, politics and more, in one single click.

Implemented user stories:

- User can view the weather in his/her current location. The app can find the
  deviceâ€™s location coordinates (longitude and latitude), if this option is
  enabled on user's device and allowed by user's browser. The page will ask for
  access to the user's location on load to update weather information. By
  default (if geolocation services are disabled) the App displays the local
  weather at Dnipro city, Ukraine.

- Background image changes depending on user's location (or selected location)
  and current weather conditions.

- Weather icon changes depending on daytime and weather conditions.

- User can search for weather information of other places.

- User can get historical data for today's date.

NOTE: For better user experience run the App on your desktop, when the weather
is not friendly: it's raining cats and dogs, snowing etc. This way you can
experience beautifull animated background effects. Enjoy =)
